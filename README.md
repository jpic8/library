Library Assignment for The Odin Project
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library#introduction

01/7/22 -- Made really great progress on this project yesterday, basically from scratch too which was great. I kept going back and forth with presenting the library info in a table or in individual div elements, and for now it seems like skipping the extra complexity of the table is probably for the best. Still a lot of junk test code in here for now. Going to pause slightly to learn more about forms and local storage so I can implement a cleaner entry process as opposed to popup alerts asking for info. Will continue revisiting the project throughout the Javascript section of The Odin Project I would imagine, which I look forward to.

01/12/22 -- Refactored JS code using a module pattern, which helped me make great strides in streamlining the logic and syntax of the overall project. Cleared out a bunch of spaghetti code and I also switched the div creation for new book entries to a list. Clearing the DOM and rendering from the array is functional, will have to continue work on the deleting of entries, and eventual form input which comes later in the curriculum.

2/21/22 -- finally circled back and finished the functionality for this one. Pulling data from the HTML forms not as complicated as I originally throught. Fun project which should serve as a good base for the next one which is the to-do list.
