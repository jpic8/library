Library Assignment for The Odin Project
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library#introduction

1/7/22 -- Made really great progress on this project yesterday, basically from scratch too which was great. I kept going back and forth with presenting the library info in a table or in individual div elements, and for now it seems like skipping the extra complexity of the table is probably for the best. Still a lot of junk test code in here for now. Going to pause slightly to learn more about forms and local storage so I can implement a cleaner entry process as opposed to popup alerts asking for info. Will continue revisiting the project throughout the Javascript section of The Odin Project I would imagine, which I look forward to.
